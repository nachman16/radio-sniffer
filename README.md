# radio-sniffer

App based on Spotify's authentication flow that sniffs songs from a Sirius radio station and adds them to a Spotify playlist.


# Ideas for features

Check duplicate in playlist (could probably load all the songs in the playlists in memory and hash that)
Create new playlsit at size X
Support different sirius stations
Support multiple users
